In this article, we will explain what the Gerard Egan Skilled Helper model is, how it works, and how you can use it as a coach to help your clients overcome their problems and develop their potential.
  
## What is the Gerard Egan Skilled Helper Model?
  
The Gerard Egan Skilled Helper model is a coaching model that aims to help people "manage their problems in living more effectively and develop unused opportunities more fully" [^1^]. It also aims to help people become better at helping themselves in their everyday lives [^1^].
  
The model consists of three stages, each with specific skills and tasks that the coach and the client need to perform. The three stages are:
  
- **Stage 1: Exploration** - In this stage, the coach helps the client to explore their current situation, identify their problems and opportunities, and clarify their goals.
- **Stage 2: Insight** - In this stage, the coach helps the client to gain a deeper understanding of their situation, challenge their assumptions and beliefs, and generate new perspectives and possibilities.
- **Stage 3: Action** - In this stage, the coach helps the client to plan and implement realistic and achievable actions that will move them towards their goals and desired outcomes.

The model is fluid and flexible, meaning that elements of each stage can appear in all of the others [^2^]. The coach can also move back and forth between stages as needed, depending on the client's progress and needs.
  
## How Does the Gerard Egan Skilled Helper Model Work?
  
The Gerard Egan Skilled Helper model works by using a collaborative and client-centered approach that empowers the client to take charge of their own change process. The coach acts as a facilitator, guide, and supporter, rather than an expert or adviser.
  
The model also works by using a range of skills and techniques that are essential for effective coaching. Some of these skills and techniques are:

- **Active listening** - The coach listens attentively and empathically to the client's verbal and non-verbal messages, without interrupting or judging.
- **Questioning** - The coach asks open-ended, probing, clarifying, challenging, and solution-focused questions that help the client to explore their situation, gain insight, and generate options.
- **Reflecting** - The coach mirrors back to the client what they have said or implied, using paraphrasing, summarizing, or reflecting feelings. This helps the client to check their understanding, express their emotions, and feel validated.
- **SOLER** - The coach uses a non-verbal listening process that involves *Sitting squarely*, *Orienting towards*, *Leaning forward*, *Eye contact*, and *Relaxing*. This helps the coach to convey interest, respect, and rapport [^4^].
- **Social influence** - The coach uses their own behaviour and personality to influence the client positively, either intentionally or unintentionally. This can include using self-disclosure, confrontation, immediacy, congruence, or genuineness [^2^] [^3^].
- **Learning theory** - The coach uses principles of learning theory to help the client learn from their own experiences and from others. This can include using observation, imitation, modelling, feedback, reinforcement, or motivation [^3^].
